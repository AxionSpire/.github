🏳️‍🌈 *LGBTQ+ owned, story-based Minecraft server project*

👋 Hello! We an innovative Minecraft: Java Edition server network creating a playable story.

📚 Our server is heavily based on lore, and we have a cyber-themed backstory behind most things.

🤝 Our code is mostly open source, so if you want to help out, just make a pull request!

🥞 Fun fact! Our team eats many different types of food for breakfast. I ([Aelithron](https://github.com/aelithron)) like eating breakfast sandwiches with iced coffee :3
