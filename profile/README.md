## AxionSpire ✨
🏳️‍🌈 *Queer-owned Minecraft server project*

👋 Hello! We are an innovative Minecraft: Java Edition server creating a playable story.
📚 Our server is heavily based on lore, and we have a cyber-themed backstory behind most things.
🤝 Our code is mostly open source, so if you want to help out, just make a pull request!
🥞 Fun fact! Our team eats many different types of food for breakfast. I ([Aelithron](https://github.com/aelithron)) like eating breakfast sandwiches with iced coffee :3
